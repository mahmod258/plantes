Its atmosphere forms about 5% to 10% of its mass and extends perhaps 10% to 20% of the way towards the core. Increasing concentrations of methane, ammonia and water are found in the lower regions.\",\r\n        \"Neptune's atmosphere is 80% hydrogen and 19% helium. A trace amount of methane is also present. Prominent absorption bands of methane exist at wavelengths above 600 nm, in the red and infrared portion of the spectrum.\",\r\n      ],\r\n      details: {\r\n        rotation_time: \"16.08 HOURS\",\r\n        revolution_time: \"164.79 YEARS\",\r\n        radius: \"24,622 KM\",\r\n        averageTemp: \"-201°C\",\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n  ]);\r\n  const initialChoose = [\r\n    {\r\n      detail: \"OVERVIEW\",\r\n      valid: \"notValid\",\r\n      style: {\r\n        color: \"white !important\",\r\n      },\r\n    },\r\n    { detail: \"STRUCTURE\", valid: \"notValid\" },\r\n    { detail: \"SURFACE\", valid: \"notValid\" },\r\n  ];\r\n  const [choose, setChoose] = useState([\r\n    { detail: \"OVERVIEW\", valid: \"valid\" },\r\n    { detail: \"STRUCTURE\", valid: \"notValid\" },\r\n    { detail: \"SURFACE\", valid: \"notValid\" },\r\n  ]);\r\n\r\n  function changeValid(i) {\r\n    let initial = initialChoose;\r\n    let valid = { detail: \"\", valid: \"valid\", color: `${data[index].color}` };\r\n    valid.detail = initial[i].detail;\r\n    initial[i] = valid;\r\n    setChoose(initial);\r\n  }\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"mainn\">\r\n      <div className=\"d-flex align-items-center justify-content-center figure\">\r\n        <img\r\n          src={data[index].img}\r\n          alt=\"\"\r\n          style={{\r\n            width: data[index].size,\r\n          }}\r\n        />\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"about\">\r\n        <div>\r\n          <h1 className=\"mb-4\" style={{ fontSize: \"45px\" }}>\r\n            {data[index].planet}\r\n          </h1>\r\n          <p\r\n            style={{\r\n              color: \"white\",\r\n              fontFamily: \"Spartan, sans-serif\",\r\n              fontSize: \"12px\",\r\n              lineHeight: \"25px\",\r\n              marginBottom: \"35px\",\r\n            }}\r\n          >\r\n            {data[index].pra[0]}\r\n          </p>\r\n          <p\r\n            style={{\r\n              fontSize: \"12px\",\r\n              fontFamily: \"Spartan, sans-serif\",\r\n              color: \"#eee\",\r\n              color: \"#7A7A89\",\r\n              margin: 0,\r\n            }}\r\n          >\r\n            Source :\r\n            <a\r\n              href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_%28planet%29\"\r\n              target=\"_blank\"\r\n            >\r\n              <b\r\n                style={{\r\n                  fontFamily: \"Spartan, sans-serif\",\r\n                  color: \"#eee\",\r\n                  color: \"#7A7A89\",\r\n                }}\r\n              >\r\n                Wikipedia\r\n              </b>\r\n              <img\r\n                src=\"https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/7161506cc08ae44d2b3d0adead5ed19c0f4806a0/7c131/assets/icon-source.svg\"\r\n                alt=\"Source Icon\"\r\n                style={{\r\n                  width: \"10px\",\r\n                  height: \"10px\",\r\n                  margin: 0,\r\n                  marginLeft: \"3px\",\r\n                  marginBottom: \"5px\",\r\n                }}\r\n              ></img>\r\n            </a>\r\n          </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div\r\n        className=\"d-flex flex-column justify-content-end  choose h-100\"\r\n        style={{ gap: \"17px\" }}\r\n      >\r\n        {choose.map((el, i) => {\r\n          return (\r\n            <button className={el.valid} key={i} onClick={() => changeValid(i)}>\r\n              <span>0{i + 1}</span>\r\n              {el.detail}\r\n            </button>\r\n          );\r\n        })}\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div>\r\n        <div className=\"d-flex justify-content-between details\">\r\n          <div>\r\n            <div>\r\n              <p>ROTATION TIME</p>\r\n              <h6>{data[index].details.rotation_time}</h6>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <div>\r\n              <p>REVOLUTION TIME</p>\r\n              <h6>{data[index].details.revolution_time}</h6>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <div>\r\n              <p>RADIUS</p>\r\n              <h6>{data[index].details.radius}</h6>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div>\r\n            <div>\r\n              <p>AVERAGE TEMP.</p>\r\n              <h6>{data[index].details.averageTemp}</h6>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n}\r\n"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
